# Digital to Finger

Browser extension that ushers in the Year of the Finger


## Installation

Fire up Chrome in Developer mode, and load in the extension from the
filesystem.

I might package this up and push it to the Chrome store once I've tested it
out a little more.


## Thanks
Big thanks to [ericwbailey](https://github.com/ericwbailey) for the [Millenials to Snake People](https://github.com/ericwbailey/millennials-to-snake-people) extension, of which this is just a simple modification.
